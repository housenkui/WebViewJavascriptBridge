How to use ?
==========================

### Installation with CocoaPods
Add this to your [podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) and run `pod install` to install:

```ruby
pod 'SKJavaScriptBridge'
```
If native want to get console.log in WKWebView just  ```[WKWebView enableLogging:LogginglevelAll];``` is enough.

### Manual installation

On Native side:

On JavaScript side:

 In fact,just one ```console.log('callNative')``` is enough to call native method.I had hack the Javascript method ```console.log```.
